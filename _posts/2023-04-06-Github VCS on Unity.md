# Github VCS on Unity
Each time you have a set of changes ready to share with your team, youâ€™ll be going through the following process to stage and commit them in git:

- **Stage** the changes to `commit - git add <FILES TO ADD>`
- **Check** that the changes are valid and complete, with no missing meta files, duplicate GUIDs etc.
- **Commit** the change - `git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE>"`
- **Push** the changes to GitHub - `git push`
