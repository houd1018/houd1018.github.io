For **VS Code**, please follow the instruction on this website and make sure all required extensions are installed: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity

If the issue persists, please check the console of VS Code (not Unity!). If the **.NET Framework 4.7.1 (Developer Pack)** is mentioned there, download and install it from the official Microsoft website. Make sure that you install this exact version. Other versions do not work.

If you use Linux or a Mac, download the latest stable MONO Framework.
